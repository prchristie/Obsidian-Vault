Example: [[Loan book from library use case]]

Captures system behaviour from the perspective of an [[Actor]]. They do not capture how the system will do anything, only what the system will do.

Made up of 5 distinct elements

1. [[Actor]]s: The different players in a scenario
2. [[Use Case]]s: Represented as a circle or oval inside the system
3. Subjects
4. [[Use Case Relationships]]
5. [[System]]

Use case diagrams may have multiple use cases represented within them, but they tend to represent a singular [[Story]] or [[Scenario]]

[[Actor]]s should have a line connecting them to the [[Use Case]] they can perform the use case
