Agile development is about iteratively improving a product by reacting to the feedback of a client. Its about delivering value quicker and getting feedback as soon as possible.

It does not prescribe the use of [[Use Case]]s or [[User Stories]], and can actually be used together as described in [[Agile Granularity]], where we see [[Use Case]]s as the higher level description that lead to [[User Stories]].
