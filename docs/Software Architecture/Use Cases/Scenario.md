A scene of how a system should or shall be used by [[Actor]]s in a system

Description of a scenario should at the very least contain
* Statement of the purpose of the scenario
* Individual user or transaction that is being followed
* Assumptions about equipment or software
* Steps of the scenario

We often create a scenario before we create a [[Use Case Diagram]]
