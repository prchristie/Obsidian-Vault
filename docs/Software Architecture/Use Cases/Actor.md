The roles that make use of a use case.

There are two types of actor:
1. Primary actors: Actors that will initiate use cases.
2. Seconary actors: Actors that react to actions in a use case.

Primary actors examples:
1. Borrower
2. Librarian
3. Operator

Secondary actors examples:
1. Bank
2. Anti-virus software
3. SMS Server
4. Timer

Can be human or an external system

When naming, we should take care to describe the role of the actor, not the name.
