As a basic template:
"As a |[[Actor]]|, I want |an action|, so that |benefit|"

1. Make list of [[Actor]]s
2. Define the [[Use Case]]s in the system. What actions might they take?
	1. Each story should contain a single action, use cases may be made up of multiple use cases.
	2. Stories should describe an intention. "I am a user and I want to be able to X"
	3. Nothing to do with tech.
3. Understand what value each [[Use Case]] will bring and if its profitable
	1. This corresponds to the "so that" section of [[User Stories]]
	2. 
4. Create [[User Stories]] out of the [[Use Case]]s.
5. Discuss [[Acceptance Criteria]] and implementation strategies.
