As a basic template:
"As a |[[Actor]]|, I want |an action|, so that |benefit|"

1. Make list of [[Actor]]s
2. Define the [[Use Case]]s in the system. What actions might they take?
3. Understand what value each [[Use Case]] will bring and if its profitable
4. Create [[User Stories]] out of the [[Use Case]]s.
5. Discuss [[Acceptance Criteria]] and implementation strategies.
