These are at what level we describe a [[Use Case]] in our system. From high level for business people to very technical for developers

4 different kinds of [[Use Case]] descriptions
1. High level: General & short descriptions for business folk
2. Expanded (detailed): A step by step of how the use case is enacted
3. Essential: A technical description with no talk of technology - EG technology independent implementation.
4. Real: How we would actually implement the use case in the current system.\
