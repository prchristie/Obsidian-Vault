The top orange brick describes the goals of the business/software/application/etc that are to be achieved by the [[System]]. These can be called [[Use Case]]s or User Features. They are very high level descriptions of the overarching functionality of the program from a user perspective.

I do not understand Epics yet.

[[User Stories]] are items that are small enough to be finished in a few days, and describe a single [[Vertical Slice]] of functionality. They are the smallest unit of work that represents some value to the user. Whereas a [[Use Case]] might describe "Select Driver" as a feature, [[User Stories]] might say "as a <[[Actor]]>, I want to be able to select from all drivers within a certain range, so that I can pick the best driver for me"
