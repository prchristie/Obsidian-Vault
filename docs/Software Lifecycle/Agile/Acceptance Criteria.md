The acceptance criteria of a user story is intended to provide a set of conditions that must be achieved before a story is complete. They provide a testing framework for a story.

Example:
If we use ![[Example user story]] as our story, we might say that the acceptance criteria could be
* The application will show all drivers in a 10km range that were online within the last 20 minutes and are not currently in an active ride
* The application will allow a passenger [[Actor]] to select any of the displayed drivers

In a future story, we might add
"As a passenger, I want to select the maximum range to find drivers, so that I can find drivers in low density areas"

and

"As a passenger, I want to be able to view a drivers profile with photos and ratings, so that I can decide if I want to ride with the selected driver."
